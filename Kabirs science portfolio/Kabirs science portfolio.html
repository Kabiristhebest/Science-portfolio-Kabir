<h2>Stuff I find intresting in science.</h2>
<p>I find sharks quite intresting since they are in danger and the need help from humans(even though) humans are the people that are thretaning there existince. I like to also explore into the world of textbook science(physics....). However my favirote type of science is proably enviormental science.</p>
